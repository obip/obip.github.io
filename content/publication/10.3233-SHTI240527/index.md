abstract: 'Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important in everyday life and medical care with a notable gap between AI development in medicine there and its practical implementation in university hospitals.
<p>
Objective: The aim was to develop a governance framework to guide the procurement and implementation of AI applications in university hospitals.
<p>
Methods: Seven role-play expert interviews were conducted with interviewees from two university hospitals, simulating realistic AI system implementation scenarios.
<p>
Results: A detailed governance framework was developed, divided into the sections general considerations, system selection criteria, and implementation. Further, a condensed version of the checklist was also derived.
<p>
Conclusion: Many aspects of AI applications in medical care, such as the establishment of an AI board, remain, along with numerous concerns about the technology. These findings provide valuable insights into the topic.

Keywords: Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Clinical; Expert Systems; Governance; Machine Learning; Physicians; Software; University Hospitals.'
